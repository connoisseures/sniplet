/*
In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u. 
In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true.
1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children.
2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.

Thought:
We can use DFS to find the back edges and use the following rule to find the articulation points. 
1) For a node, u, if there is no back from its descendants to one of its ancestors, and this node is not a root of DFS tree, this node is an articulation point.
2) For a node, u, if it is the root of DFS tree and it has at least two children, it is also a articulation point. 

Time complexity : 
T = O(V+E), where v is the number of nodes and E is the number of the edges.
